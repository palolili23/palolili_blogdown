<p>While I was living in Buenos Aires, Argentina I had the opportunity to meet two kind, strong and super smart women: <a href="https://www.minedogucu.com/">Mine Dogucu</a> and <a href="https://lacion.rbind.io/">Laura Aci√≥n</a>. They did not only encouraged me to pursuit a PhD, but it is thanks to them that <a href="https://twitter.com/rladiesba">Rladies Buenos Aires</a> was born.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://blog.rladies.org/post/vacation_grow_rladiesnetwork/">post</a> we wrote together for the R-Ladies Global blog we tell you all the details about how couch surfing led to the expansion of the R-Ladies Network in Latin America.</p>
