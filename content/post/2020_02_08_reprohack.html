<p>On Saturday 30 November, 44 excited researchers gathered at the Leiden University Library to join the very first ReproHack – short for Reproducibility Hackathon – in the Netherlands. In a nutshell, a ReproHack is aimed at assessing the reproducibility of scientific research that publicly shared code and data. During a ReproHack, participants get to work with other people’s material in a low pressure environment and record their experiences on a number of key aspects, including reproducibility, transparency and reusability of materials.</p>
<p>We share our experience of organizing this event in the <a href="https://software.ac.uk/blog/2020-01-15-reproducibility-hackathon-netherlands-aftermath">post</a> we wrote for the Software Sustainability Institute.</p>
