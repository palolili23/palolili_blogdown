While I was living in Buenos Aires, Argentina I had the opportunity to meet  two kind, strong and super smart women: [Mine Dogucu](https://www.minedogucu.com/) and [Laura AciÃ³n](https://lacion.rbind.io/). They did not only encouraged me to pursuit a PhD, but it is thanks to them that [Rladies Buenos Aires](https://twitter.com/rladiesba) was born.

In the [post](http://blog.rladies.org/post/vacation_grow_rladiesnetwork/) we wrote together for the R-Ladies Global blog we tell you all the details about how couch surfing led to the expansion of the R-Ladies Network in Latin America.
