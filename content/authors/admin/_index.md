I am a PhD student at the Epidemiology Department of Erasmus MC, and I am a part of the Causal Inference Group and the Neuro-Epidemiology Group. My research is focused on applying causal inference methods in cohort studies, specifically to emulate target trials for long-term exposures related to dementia and to understand the role of competing events in this setting. I am also an R enthusiast and advocate of open science.

I keep my heart close to home in La Paz, Bolivia.
